\chapter{Model Implementation}

In this chapter, I will detail the various changes and adjustments made to the original architectures of KARINA and ConvNext to better suit a local model at a resolution of 0.25Â°. The aim is to develop a regional machine learning weather prediction model that leverages the strengths of both KARINA and FourCastNet.\\

The original KARINA architecture was designed for global weather prediction and thus, certain modifications are necessary to adapt it to a regional model. Similarly, while ConvNext is a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network, it "may" requires modifications to be applicable to our specific use case.\\

In the following sections, I will provide a detailed explanation of each modification made to the original architectures and the rationale behind them. By the end of this chapter, we will have a clear understanding of how the original architectures were adapted to create a regional machine learning weather prediction model.\\

As viewed in the introduction on the section "models", the first implementation is "simply" a local forecast with as input the regional state at time t and as output that same regional state at time t+dt (6h).\\

Model0 is the playground of that first model where i try to understand how and what are the possiblities to adapt KARINA's model to a local model.\\
